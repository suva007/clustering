# CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS 
# kmeans.ipynb : 
   - best for datasets that has centroids at mean position of clusters.
   - contains graphical representation of how centroid position changes with change in mean and for different iterations
   - contains ARI AND silhouette SCORE metric as well.
# pnng-2.ipynb
   - minimum spanning tree based clustering algorithm.
   - improves time complexity of this mst based approach from O(n^2) to O(n^3/2).
   - for detail discription refer fast approximate mst.pdf
# agglomerative_algorithm.ipynb
   - hierarichal clustering everything you need.
# mst_divisive.ipynn
   - mst based clustering on not very desirable dataset.
# DETERMINISTIC KMEANS.ipynb
   - deterministic initialization algorithm for K-means (DK-means) by exploring a set of probable centers through a constrained bi-partitioning approach. The proposed algorithm is compared with classical K-means with random initialization and improved K-means variants such as K-means++ and MinMax algorithms.

# DC.ipynb
   - categorical + numerical data.
   - clustering algorithm = agglomerative(hierarichal).
# dc_heart.ipynb
   - purely numerical high dimensional data.
   - clustering algorithm = agglomerative(hierarichal).
# dc_last.ipynb
   - categorical data = ordinal + nominal.
   - clustering algorithm = kmode.
# dc_nursery_kmod.ipynb
   - categorical data = ordinal + nominal.
   - clustering algorithm = kmode.
